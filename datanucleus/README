Goals:
1. show a possible implementation using datanucleus as the backend storage provider

Notes:
1. this no longer works as it requires the underlying "datastore" infrastructure project to be providing JDO, which it no longer is
2. implementing both JDO and JPA specs requires a fair bit of effort, unfortunately, JPA is more widely adopted even though JDO provides more features, works with more 
databases, etc.
3. this project was meant to show what would happen when you audit an entity
	in JPA, Hibernate will throw an exception if you try to modify an entity (through a JPA Event Listener);
	in JDO, the spec basically just says, use commmon sense, don't shoot yourself in the foot and as the example here shows,
		you can easily audit entities if you so choose as long as you're careful
