Goals:
1. show how to persist a Java class / enum to an entity as a field / member
   a. this was meant to be part of a workflow project where the steps are constrained to a particular workflow
   b. additionally, this was meant to show how it could be used for job execution
2. show that storing entities in separate repositories means the data is isolated
   a. multiple tenants
   b. replaying transactions from another node?

Notes:
1. this no longer works most likely because I removed @Primary and @Secondary support (again, that was to get around JPA restrictions where when I save an entity, I want to 
trigger a bunch of jobs downstream (in repository B))
